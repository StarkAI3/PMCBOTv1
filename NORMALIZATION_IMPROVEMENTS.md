# PMC Data Normalization Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the significant improvements made to the PMC data normalization script to enhance semantic search accuracy and bot response quality.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced Content Extraction
**Problem**: Original script only used `title` and `description` fields, missing valuable content in HTML summaries and other fields.

**Solution**: 
- Added comprehensive content extraction from all available fields
- Implemented HTML cleaning using BeautifulSoup to extract meaningful text
- Created `full_content` field that combines all available text content
- Preserved original fields while adding enhanced content

**Impact**: 
- Much richer semantic content for vector embeddings
- Better search results for complex queries
- No data loss - all original information preserved

### 2. Improved Type Classification
**Problem**: Many records were classified as "other" instead of meaningful categories.

**Solution**:
- Expanded type mapping with 20+ categories instead of 15
- Added keyword-based classification for better pattern matching
- Implemented fallback classification based on content analysis
- Added new categories: tax, utility, waste, transport, construction

**Impact**:
- Better categorization of records (961 department, 229 crematorium, 175 project, etc.)
- More accurate filtering and search results
- Improved bot responses with better context

### 3. HTML Content Cleaning
**Problem**: HTML tags and formatting were not cleaned, reducing semantic quality.

**Solution**:
- Added BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing
- Implemented `clean_html_text()` function
- Decoded HTML entities
- Normalized whitespace and formatting

**Impact**:
- Clean, semantic text for embeddings
- Better understanding of content by AI models
- Improved search accuracy

### 4. Enhanced Field Mapping
**Problem**: Limited use of available fields reduced search context.

**Solution**:
- Added extraction of: long_description, summary, department, ward_name, contact info
- Preserved all original fields in metadata
- Added semantic context fields (department, ward, type)

**Impact**:
- Richer context for semantic search
- Better answers to location-specific queries
- Improved department and ward-based searches

### 5. Marathi Language Support
**Problem**: Need to ensure proper handling of Marathi content.

**Solution**:
- Maintained language field (`lang`) for all records
- Ensured UTF-8 encoding throughout
- Preserved original Marathi content in all fields
- Added support for Marathi keywords in type classification

**Impact**:
- Proper handling of Marathi queries
- Support for mixed language content
- Better responses to Marathi user queries

## Technical Implementation

### New Functions Added:

1. **`clean_html_text(text)`**: Cleans HTML content and extracts meaningful text
2. **`extract_all_text_content(record)`**: Extracts all available text content from a record
3. **Enhanced `map_to_main_type()`**: Improved type classification with keyword matching
4. **Enhanced `extract_from_node()`**: Better field extraction and content processing

### Enhanced Embedding Process:

1. **`extract_text_for_embedding(rec)`**: Uses the new `full_content` field for better embeddings
2. **Improved metadata filtering**: Preserves important context fields
3. **Better chunking**: More intelligent text chunking for large documents

## Results

### Before Improvements:
- 2550 records with mostly "other" classification
- Limited content extraction (title + description only)
- HTML content not cleaned
- Poor semantic search accuracy

### After Improvements:
- 2550 records with meaningful classifications:
  - 961 department records
  - 229 crematorium records  
  - 175 project records
  - 166 hospital records
  - 135 committee_decision records
  - 118 garden records
  - 117 circular records
  - And many more specific categories

- Rich content extraction with `full_content` field
- Clean HTML content for better semantic understanding
- Enhanced metadata for improved search context

## Benefits for Users

### 1. Accurate Answers on All Query Types
- **Before**: Limited to basic title/description matching
- **After**: Comprehensive content search across all fields and categories

### 2. No Data Loss
- **Before**: Some content was ignored or not properly extracted
- **After**: All available content is preserved and utilized

### 3. Marathi Language Support
- **Before**: Basic language detection
- **After**: Full support for Marathi content and queries, including transliterated text

### 4. Better Semantic Understanding
- **Before**: Raw HTML and limited context
- **After**: Clean, structured content with rich metadata

## Usage

The improved normalization script can be run with:
```bash
python scripts/normalize_pmc_data.py
```

This will:
1. Process all JSONL files in the data directory
2. Apply enhanced normalization
3. Generate improved `pmc_data_normalized.jsonl`
4. Show statistics on record distribution

The enhanced embedding script will automatically use the improved content:
```bash
python scripts/embed_and_upsert.py
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Semantic Keywords**: Add domain-specific keywords for better classification
2. **Content Summarization**: Generate concise summaries for better search
3. **Entity Extraction**: Extract named entities (people, places, organizations)
4. **Temporal Analysis**: Better date handling and temporal queries
5. **Geographic Context**: Enhanced location-based search capabilities

## Conclusion

These improvements significantly enhance the semantic search accuracy and bot response quality by:
- Extracting and utilizing all available content
- Providing better categorization and context
- Ensuring proper handling of both English and Marathi content
- Maintaining data integrity while improving search capabilities

The enhanced system will provide more accurate, comprehensive, and contextually relevant responses to user queries in both English and Marathi.
